### Hi there, I'm Esteban Nathan Guzman ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an AI-focused Software Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I have experience building data-driven solutionsâ€”from optimizing strategic decision-making with a Catan AI Agent to designing robust video classification models that understand dance styles. I hold a Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford and a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

**What Iâ€™m Working On:**  
- Building AI-driven models and pipelines that solve real-world problems.
- Exploring reinforcement learning techniques to enhance agent decision-making.
- Developing end-to-end ML solutions, from data ingestion to model deployment.

**Skills & Technologies:**  
- **AI/ML:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision  
- **Data & Backend:** SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Data Mining, Docker, CI/CD  
- **Web & APIs:** Django, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS  
- **Other:** Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Responsive Design, SEO

**What Iâ€™m Looking For:**  
- Opportunities to leverage advanced AI methods to create impactful, scalable solutions.
- Roles that encourage continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation in AI-driven software.
